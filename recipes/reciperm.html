      These pumpkin cookies are my fall go-to treat! The balance of spices and pumpkin flavor, combined with semi-sweet chocolate chips, makes them irresistible. I love making these with my family every year when it's fall.

    <h2><span class="subtitle">Ingredients</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted & slightly cooled</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>6 Tablespoons (86g) pumpkin puree (see note)*</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 cups (188g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (90g) semi-sweet chocolate chips, plus a few extra for the tops</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the vanilla and blotted pumpkin until smooth. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft. Fold in 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine.</li>
      <li>Cover the dough and chill for 30 minutes or up to 3 days. Chilling the dough is imperative for this recipe.</li>
      <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
      <li>Scoop the dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and roll each into balls. Arrange cookie dough balls 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Using the back of a spoon or the bottom of a cup/measuring cup, slightly flatten the tops of the dough balls. (Without doing so, the cookies may not spread.)</li>
      <li>Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set. The cookies will look very soft in the center. Remove from the oven. If you find that your cookies didn't spread much at all, flatten them out with the back of a spoon when you take them out of the oven. If desired, press a few chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is only for looks.</li>
      <li>Cool cookies on the baking sheets for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. The longer the cookies cool, the even better they taste! The flavor gets stronger and the texture becomes chewier. I usually let them sit, uncovered, for several hours before serving. Chewiness and pumpkin flavor are even stronger on day 2.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pumpkin Puree: Squeeze as much of the moisture out of the pumpkin puree as you can before adding it to the cookie dough. I simply squeeze the puree with paper towels. See photo in the post for a visual. This will help produce a less cakey cookie. Less moisture is a good thing here! Measure 6 Tablespoons AFTER the pumpkin has been squeezed/blotted. Do not use pumpkin pie filling.</li>
    </ul>
