        <p >Now that you have your ingredients, let's make the pies.</p>

        
        <div class="instructions">
        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        
        <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine <b>one cup cold water</b>, <b>one package instant vanilla pudding</b>, and <b>one can sweetened condensed milk.</b>
            whisk thouroughly until completely combined. Then, set it inside the fridge for a few moments to chill.</li>
        <li>Using an electric mixer, mix the <b>heavy whipping cream</b> until light peaks form. Set aside all but <b>one cup</b> and store in the fridge for later.
            Take the extra cup and dollop it in with the <b></b>vanilla pudding mixture</b> from Step 1. </li>
        <li>Cut slightly thick slices of <b>banana</b> and line the bottom of the <b>two crusts.</b> Take the completed filling mixture and evenly distribute
            between the crusts. Then, put the lids on them and set them in the fridge for several hours.</li>
        <li>Once the pies have chilled, begin by prepping the final layer. Take the leftover <b>whipped cream</b> from <b>Step 2</b> and mix in <b>1/3 cup powdered sugar.</b>
            Once completed, evenly distrubute between the pies.</li>
        <li>Add <b>graham cracker sprinkle</b> and <b>bananas</b> on top for a little extra touch (optional).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mix the water and the pudding first, then add the sweetened condensed milk once combined. This will help remove  
                the random chunks of unmixed pudding powder.</li>
            <li>Make sure the pies chill for a good amount of time or the crust will fall apart and the flavor will not be
                as banana-y.</li>
            <li>Don't forget the powdered sugar or the top layer of cream won't have that touch of sweetness!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This recipe is one that I stumbled upon at random... but now I know it by heart! It has been a favorite with family and friends,
            parties, and other events I have brought them to! Not only is it easy, but the finished product is something that 
            always has people (you included!) running back for seconds. It has the perfect mix of that base vanilla pudding flavor 
            with the desired banana flavor, truly making it the perfect pie. I hope you enjoy eating and making it as much as I do.
