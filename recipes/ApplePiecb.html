            On the stove, make paste with butter and flour. Add water and sugar to help it broil. Simmer then remove from heat.

            <li>
            Mold one crust into pie plate. Place sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top to make a lattice crust. Pour butter and sugar mixture over the lattice crust.

            Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apple are soft and crust is golden. Baking will bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes.

<h2 class="orange">Why I Love It, and Why You Should Too</h2>
<h3 class="brown">There are many reasons why this apple pie is my favorite. When I was a young child I was raised by Darth Vader. When my father died, Mr. Figglebottom raised me and taught me how to make this wonderful recipe. When Mr. Figglebottom died, Barney the dinosaur raised me. I cooked this pie for barney every day. It helped me feel happy anytime I was sad. You should love it because it is homemade and not made from a store.</h3>
