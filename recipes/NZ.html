            <p>I chose this recipe because I have a succinct memory of seeing mashed potatoes on the dinner table and this recipe is the exact one my mother would make for me when I was young. The experience transcended my body to a higher plane of existence, and thus, I am writing this paragraph from the celestial corners of the universe, unobstructed by the perils of modern society, with the ability to enjoy my mashed potatoes in peace. Still, it is quite lonely when all the universe's knowledge is at your fingertips, the world's collective conscience pales in comparison to the experience of the intelligence of mashed potatoes.</p>
