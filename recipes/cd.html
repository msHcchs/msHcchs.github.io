        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pasta (penne, spaghetti, take your pick)</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pine nuts (Don't use walnuts or anything else as an alternative, it completley changes the taste of the dish)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (this could get expensive, but the more expensive, the better pesto you're gonna have)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, diced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, personal prefrence</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon (optional, for added brightness)</li>
        </ul>

 <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cook the Pasta:</b>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook it however long you want, I prefer al dente (Usually 8-10 minutes).</li>
            <li><b>Make the Pesto:</b> While the pasta cooks, place the basil leaves, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and your salt in the food blender. Pulse until it looks like a green sauce, not completley liquid.</li>
            <li><b>Add Olive Oil:</b> After the other ingredients are blended, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the pesto reaches a smooth and creamy consistency. If its thick, good. Pesto is supposed to be more of a sauce thats kinda thick. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li><b>Combine the Pasta and Pesto:</b> Toss the cooked pasta with the pesto sauce</li>
            <li><b>Buon Giorno:</b> Eat the pesto pasta with extra grated Parmesan, and add fresh basil leaves (if you want, they're pretty expensive).</li>
        </ol>
